# Hi i am  ajoshKrajan 

I have experience working as a Robotics Mentor, where I trained students in robotics, basic electronics, and programming. I have hands-on experience with tools and platforms like PictoBlox, Arduino, and basic Python.

I enjoy teaching students through practical, project-based learning, such as home automation, voice-controlled systems, and AI-based beginner projects. I am passionate about helping students understand technology in a simple and engaging way, and I am continuously improving my technical and communication skills.

I am looking forward to growing further in the robotics and automation field and contributing my skills to impactful learning environments.
